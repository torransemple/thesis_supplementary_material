## Introductory notes
```{r}

# DESCRIPTION AND TABLE OF CONTENTS (follow AAP code as guide)

```


## Interpretation/formulation of independent variables
```{r}

# FOODBANK - indicator group = used foodbank in the last 12 months; control = otherwise (i.e., not used foodbank in the last 12 months)
# NEIGHBOURS - indicator group = relied on neighbours for food in the last year; control group = otherwise
# CLOSE_FAM_FRIENDS - indicator group = rrelied on family and friends for food in the last year; control group = otherwise
# COM_FAITH_GROUP - indicator group = relied on a community/faith group for food in the last year; control group = otherwise
# AGE_25_to_34 - indicator group = aged 25 to 34; control group = other ages
# AGE_Under_25 - indicator group = aged under 25; control group = other ages
# HP_ILLNESS_Yes - indicator group = yes, health problem or illness present; control group = no, health problem or illness not present
# LIFE_SAT_High - indicator group = high/very high life satisfaction; control group = otherwise
# FAM_FRIENDS_Large_extent - indicator group = relies on family and friends to a large extent for general help; control group = otherwise
# HOUSING_PAYMENTS_WORRY_Almost_every_month - indicator group = worries about housing payments almost every month; control group = otherwise
# AVOID_RAW_FOOD_Never - indicator group = never avoids purchasing raw food; control group = otherwise
# HH_INCOME_Less_than_14900 - indicator group = HH income less than Â£14,900 per year; control group = otherwise
# PREPAY_PAYG - indicator group = pays for energy using prepayment/PAYG meter; control group = otherwise

```


## Controlling for the potential effects of multicollinearity between independent variables
```{r}

# Calculate the correlation matrix for the dataset.
corr_matrix <- cor(ES_data)

write.csv(x=corr_matrix, file="Cor_Matrix_ES_Model.csv") # Write csv to inspect correlation matrix in Excel - variables with correlation coefficients < -0.3 or > 0.3 not included in the same model to control for collinearity

print(corr_matrix) # alternatively, print in R. None of the independent variables have pairwise correlation coefficients <-0.3 or >0.3. 


```


## Specify a fixed parameters ordered probit (FPOP) model using the 'Rchoice' package
```{r}

# First, recode dependent variable as a factor

library(car) # load car package for recoding DV
ES_data$OP_FUEL_SECURITY <- car::recode(ES_data$OP_FUEL_SECURITY, as.factor=TRUE, "1=1; 2=2; 3=3; 4=4")

library(Rchoice)

### Fixed parameters ordered probit (FPOP) (NOTE: Not final FPOP - re-estimate after all variables in RPOP known)

FPOP_ES <- Rchoice(OP_FUEL_SECURITY ~ HP_ILLNESS_Yes + HH_INCOME_Less_than_14900 + AGE_Under_25 + AGE_25_to_34 + PREPAY_PAYG + NEIGHBOURS + COM_FAITH_GROUP + CLOSE_FAM_FRIENDS + FAM_FRIENDS_Large_extent + FOODBANK + AVOID_RAW_FOOD_Never + HOUSING_PAYMENTS_WORRY_Almost_every_month + LIFE_SAT_High, data=ES_data, family=ordinal("probit"))

summary(FPOP_ES) # All variables significant (t-stat (z-value) > 1.96 corresponding to p-value = 0.05), with the exception of 'AGE_25_to_34' which does produce a significant coefficient in the more advanced model - see below

```


## Specify a random parameters ordered probit (RPOP) model, i.e., the final model presented in Chapter 4
```{r}

### Random parameters ordered probit (RPOP)

RPOP_ES <- Rchoice(OP_FUEL_SECURITY ~ HP_ILLNESS_Yes + HH_INCOME_Less_than_14900 + AGE_Under_25 + AGE_25_to_34 + PREPAY_PAYG + NEIGHBOURS + COM_FAITH_GROUP + CLOSE_FAM_FRIENDS + FAM_FRIENDS_Large_extent + FOODBANK + AVOID_RAW_FOOD_Never + HOUSING_PAYMENTS_WORRY_Almost_every_month + LIFE_SAT_High, data=ES_data, family=ordinal("probit"), ranp=c(HP_ILLNESS_Yes="n", AGE_Under_25="n", COM_FAITH_GROUP="n"), R=500)
    
summary(RPOP_ES) # summarise model
