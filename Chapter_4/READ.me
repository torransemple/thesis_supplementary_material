# Chapter 4: Modeling Individual Energy Security

This repository section contains the R code used for the quantitative analysis and modeling presented in **Chapter 4: [Insert Full Chapter Title Here]** of the PhD thesis, *"The Modern Problematisation of Fuel Poverty in England: Quantification, Obfuscation and Energy Transitions."*

The purpose of this code is to operationalise and analyze novel socioeconomic indicators derived from financial data to model individual-level energy security and fuel stress.

| Filename | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`CH4_energy_security_model.Rmd`** | R Markdown file containing the full script for data pre-processing, model estimation, and diagnostic testing for the Chapter 4 analysis. |
| **`CH4_energy_security_model.html`** | Rendered HTML output of the R Markdown file, allowing for quick inspection of all figures, tables, and model outputs without requiring R to be installed. |

## Methodology Summary

The code estimates a [State Model Type, e.g., logistic regression, fixed effects model] to examine the relationship between financial security, committed expenditure, and area-level energy costs. The analysis is used to derive and validate the predictive power of a **Financial Footprint-Derived Energy Security Metric** for identifying households/individuals at risk of fuel poverty.

## Data and Reproducibility Notice

Due to the proprietary and sensitive nature of the input data (Smart Data Foundry's Income Volatility Dataset and derived Energy Performance Certificate data), the original datasets **cannot be included** in this public repository.
